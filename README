## Regarding This Mod

Town Of Host: The Other Roles (The Mod) is considered a Host Only Mod (or, Host Only Environment). This means that only The Host needs to install the mod (on a Windows Operating System) for it to work. Once The Host creates a modded lobby, clients (players) from any device are able to join and enjoy The Mod.<br>

The Following Restriction(s) Apply<br>

- If The Host leaves in the middle of a game, The Mod will no longer work (i.e. the roles will no longer function as intended). This happens regardless of whether the client is modded (has joined the lobby with The Mod) or not (termed 'vanilla').<br>

Benefits Of Being A Modded Client.<br>

- Custom start screen displaying Role Name & Ability/Win Condition(Victory Parameters)
- Custom victory screen reflecting the Role's unique win condition.
- Ability to view additional settings in lobby.
- Custom buttons in game.
- More detailed task log.
- etc.

## Known Bugs

- Modded Clients have been witnessed to blackscreen upon game start.
- Desynced Killing Roles have been witnessed to blackscreen upon Death (Vote & Kill).

### Template
This function allows you to send prepared messages.<br>
Execute by typing `/template <tag>` or `/t <tag>`.<br>
To set the text, edit `template.txt` in the same folder as AmongUs.exe.<br>
Separate each entry with a colon, such as `tag:content`.<br>
Also, you can break lines by writing `\n` in the sentence like `tag:line breaks can be\nmade like this`.<br>

#### Welcome Message
If the tag is set to "welcome" in the template function, it will be sent automatically when a player joins.<br>
For example: `welcome:This room is using the mod Town Of Host: The Other Roles.`

### Impostor Disconnect Detection
If all Impostors leave the game, the game will automatically end with the unused Impostor Disconnected screen. This was done as all impostors leaving the game would black screen all players who do not use desynced Impostor roles after the next meeting.

#### Notes

Roles without a redirect mean they are not implemented yet but are planned.

## GM

The GM (Game Master) is an observer role.<br>
Their presence has no effect on the game itself, and all players know who the GM is at all times.<br>
Always assigned to a host and is ghosted from the start.<br>

# Impostors

## Assassin 

__Team__: Impostor<br>
__Base__: Impostor<br>
__Ability__: Guess Crewmate Roles To Kill<br>

#### Role Description 
Assassin is an evil guesser that is on the impostor team.<br>
While in game, Assassin may kill like any other impostor.<br>
While in meeting, the Assassin can use '/shoot show' to guess a role.<br>
The Assassin suicides if they miss-guess.<br>

#### How To Use '/shoot show'
Type '/shoot show' for a list of all possible roleIDs and playerIDs.<br>
Guess a players role using the command '/shoot (playerID) (roleID)' (e.g. /shoot 5 9).<br>
'/shoot show' and '/shoot (playerID) (roleID)' are visible for everyone. The lists are not.<br>
Be careful! The roleIDs change every meeting.<br>
